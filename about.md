My name is Kevin Aung or you could also call me by my [Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese) name Ko Aung.  I'm a full stack Microsoft .NET software engineer living in Las Vegas, NV.  I've done projects ranging from web apps to full automation systems.  I have a new found love for Javascript and all things Javascript.  Web tech is home for me.  Now a days, I am a student of everything tech.  I read, I explore, I conquer (or try to anyways).

Besides coding, I like food, snowboarding, and UFC.  You'll often see me doing one of those things.

If you want to chat about coding or any of the above, feel free to slide into my DM on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/kkaung15).
